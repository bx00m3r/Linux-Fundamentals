# Navigation in Linux

## Introduction
Navigation in Linux is fundamental, just like using a mouse in a standard Windows environment. It allows us to move across the system, work with directories and files, and optimize output using various commands and options.

One of the best ways to learn Linux navigation is through experimentation. This section covers essential navigation commands, creating and managing files and directories, searching for files, using redirects, and understanding file descriptors. We also explore shortcuts that enhance efficiency while working in the terminal. It is recommended to experiment on a locally hosted VM and create a snapshot in case the system gets unexpectedly damaged.

## Finding Your Current Directory
Before navigating through the system, we must determine our current directory. We can do this using the `pwd` (print working directory) command:

```bash
pwd
```

Example output:
```bash
/home/user
```

## Listing Directory Contents
To list the contents of a directory, we use the `ls` command:

```bash
ls
```

Example output:
```bash
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  Music  Pictures  Public  Templates  Videos
```

Adding the `-l` option provides detailed information about files and directories:

```bash
ls -l
```

Example output:
```bash
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 2 user group 4096 Nov 13 17:37 Desktop
drwxr-xr-x 2 user group 4096 Nov 13 17:34 Documents
...
```

### Understanding `ls -l` Output
| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| drwxr-xr-x | File type and permissions |
| 2 | Number of hard links |
| user | Owner of the file/directory |
| group | Group owner |
| 4096 | Size (bytes) or blocks used |
| Nov 13 17:37 | Last modified date and time |
| Desktop | Name of the directory |

## Viewing Hidden Files
Hidden files start with a dot (`.`) and are not visible with a simple `ls` command. To view them, use:

```bash
ls -la
```

Example output:
```bash
drwxr-xr-x 2 user group 4096 Nov 13 17:37 .bashrc
drwxr-xr-x 2 user group 4096 Nov 13 17:37 .bash_history
...
```

## Listing Contents of a Specific Directory
We can list contents without navigating to a directory by specifying its path:

```bash
ls -l /var/
```

Example output:
```bash
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 May 15 18:54 backups
drwxr-xr-x 18 root root 4096 Nov 15 16:55 cache
...
```

## Changing Directories
To move between directories, use the `cd` (change directory) command:

```bash
cd /dev/shm
```

Example output:
```bash
user@system:/dev/shm$
```

To return to the previous directory:

```bash
cd -
```

## Auto-Completion
To make navigation easier, we can use auto-completion. Press `[TAB]` twice after typing part of a command or directory name to see available options:

```bash
cd /dev/s [TAB 2x]
```

Example output:
```bash
shm/ snd/
```

If only one match exists, pressing `[TAB]` will complete the command automatically.

## Navigating to the Parent Directory
The `..` symbol represents the parent directory. To move up one level:

```bash
cd ..
```

Example:
```bash
user@system:/dev/shm$ cd ..
user@system:/dev$
```

## Clearing the Terminal
To clear the terminal screen:

```bash
clear
```

Alternatively, use the shortcut:

```bash
[Ctrl] + [L]
```

## Command History
We can scroll through previously used commands using the up (`↑`) and down (`↓`) arrow keys. To search for a command in history:

```bash
[Ctrl] + [R]
```

Start typing to find matching commands.
