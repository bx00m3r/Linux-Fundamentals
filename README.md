# 🐧 Linux Fundamentals – Quick Reference & Guide

Hey there! 👋

This repository is a collection of Linux fundamentals I documented while working through the **Linux Fundamentals** course on [Hack The Box Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/details/18). Whether you're just starting out or need a quick refresher, this repo is meant to be your go-to guide to understand essential Linux concepts with clarity and confidence.

You’ll find notes organized by topic, each in its own markdown file – clean, focused, and beginner-friendly.

✅ Ideal for:
- Beginners wanting a solid Linux foundation
- Learners preparing for practical security or DevOps tasks
- Anyone looking to quickly look up or brush up on a topic

🛠️ **Note**: This is not a replacement for the official course, but a helpful companion or refresher.
