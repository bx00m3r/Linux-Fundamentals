# Editing Files in Linux 📝

Alright, now that we know how to create files and directories, let’s learn how to edit them! Linux has several text editors, but we'll start with **Nano**, a simple and easy-to-use editor for beginners.

---

## Using Nano 🐧

To create and edit a file using Nano, just type:

```bash
nano notes.txt
```

This opens the Nano editor and creates (or opens) `notes.txt`, letting you start editing immediately.

### Basic Nano Controls ⚡

- `[CTRL + O]` – Save the file
- `[ENTER]` – Confirm the filename
- `[CTRL + X]` – Exit Nano
- `[CTRL + W]` – Search for a word in the file
- `[CTRL + K]` – Cut text
- `[CTRL + U]` – Paste text

💡 *Tip: The `^` symbol in Nano’s interface stands for the [CTRL] key.*

After making changes, save your file and exit Nano using `[CTRL + O]`, `[ENTER]`, and `[CTRL + X]`.

To view the file you just edited, use:

```bash
cat notes.txt
```

## Important Linux Files 🔐

Linux has many important system files. One such file is:

```bash
/etc/passwd
```

This file stores user information like usernames and user IDs. However, sensitive data like password hashes are stored in `/etc/shadow`, which has stricter security settings.

💡 *As a beginner, always be cautious when modifying system files!* 🚨

## Using Vim 🔥

Nano is great for quick edits, but **Vim** is a powerful editor that many developers and sysadmins swear by.

To open Vim, type:

```bash
vim
```

But wait! Vim works **differently** from Nano. It has multiple modes:

- **Normal Mode** – Used for navigation and commands.
- **Insert Mode** – Where you type text (Press `i` to enter insert mode).
- **Command Mode** – Execute commands (Press `:` to enter command mode).

To exit Vim:

```bash
:q   # Quit (if no changes were made)
:wq  # Save and quit
:q!  # Quit without saving
```
